<u><h4><a name="Section1">Section I - Components</a></h4></u>
D0Tweak is a collection is miscellaneous enhancements for BG2 (with or without ToB) and BG1Tutu. Components which apply to Tutu are marked as such in <font color="#339900">green</font> below.
<p>
<u>1: Enhanced Goodberries</u> <font color="#339900">(BG1Tutu Compatible!)</font>
<br>
The Goodberries spell was effectively useless in the original game. The
ability to consume an item in combat and heal 1 hit point is pointless
when you're level 30.<br>
This component causes the amount of hit points healed by Goodberries to
increase with levels. The progression is as follows:
<p>
<TABLE border="1"
          summary="Goodberry values">
<TH colspan="100">

<TR><TD><b>Level</b><TD><b>Hit Points Healed</b>
<TR>
<TR><TD>3 (or less)<TD>1
<TR><TD>6<TD>3
<TR><TD>9<TD>5
<TR><TD>12<TD>7
<TR><TD>15<TD>9
<TR><TD>18<TD>11
<TR><TD>21<TD>13
</TABLE>
<p>

<u>2: Corrected Summonned Demon Behaviour</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the BG2 Fixpack at G3. (<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/</a>)</font>
<br>
This component alters the AI of summonned demons, causing them to behave
less predictably, but at the same time, more realistically (ie. Baatezu
will attack Tanar'ri). The alignments of the summonned demon CREs are
corrected by this component, but ideally, this component should be used
with the Alignment Fixes included in the Oversight mod.
<p>

<u>3: Corrected Demon Animations</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the BG2 Fixpack at G3. (<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/</a>)</font>
<br>
Throughout SoA, it seems that Bioware were unable to decide what
animations they should use for various demons. This attempts to
rectify this by standardising the use of animations. All Glabrezru
in SoA now use the new animation that shipped with ToB. All Pit
Fiends now use the "raver" or Ravager animation (for lack of one fitting
the PnP description more closely), and all Balor now use the winged
demon animation.<br>
Although the changes in this component only affects SoA (the animation
choices in ToB were more sane), the Glabrezru animation changes will
only occur if you have ToB installed.
<p>

<u>4: Reintroduce Dimension Door</u>
<br>
This component reintroduces Dimension Door into the game as a spell
usable by the player. Sorcerors can learn it as normal, and scrolls
are added to two stores throughout the game (one in SoA and one in ToB).
Note that Dimension Door can potentially break the game (this was presumably
why it was removed in the first place), so be careful how you use it.
<p>
<u>5: Tweaked Weapon Enchantments</u>
<br>
This component changes the enchantments of several creature weapons in
the game. Planetars and Devas now wield +4 weapons, Wraith Sarevok now
wields a +3 weapon (removing the exploit of gaining immunity to normal
and +1 weapons before facing him), and the Totemic Druid's Spirit Animals
all gain +2 weapon enchantment.<br>
The result of this is that Planetars and Devas will become slightly more
effective, Wraith Sarevok will become slightly tougher, and Spirit Animals
will become slightly more useful.
<p>
<u>6: Additional Racial Enemies</u>
<br>
This component reintroduces some of the racial enemies that were available
in BG1 but no longer so in BG2. It also adds some new racial enemy options
which were not previously available, so that the majority of the creatures
you will encounter during the course of the game are covered.
<p>
<u>7: Summoning Limit Removal</u>
<br>
This component does exactly what it says on the box: removes the summonning
limit. All anti-summon spells should function as normal. Note that an increased number of creatures on the screen may increase BG2's system requirements beyond those of the default game.
<p>
Note that the limit of one celestial in ToB is unaffected.
<p>
<u>8: PnP Celestial Fury</u>
<br>
This component does NOT modify the abilities of Celestial Fury to make it
more closely in line with its PnP equivalent. It does, however, add one
of the features of the PnP incarnation which was absent in BG2: Now, if someone
is wielding Celestial Fury in an outdoor area, it will begin to rain. Simple
as that.
<p>
<u>9: Ghreyfain's Holy Symbol Fix</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the BG2 Fixpack at G3. (<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/</a>)</font>
<br>
This is Ghrey's old Holy Symbol Fix converted to WeiDU. Basically, it makes
the granting of Holy Symbols in the game a bit more logical. Aerie gets the
symbol of Baervan, Viconia gets the symbol of Shar, and Anomen gains the symbol
of Helm even when lawful good (he used to get Lathander's).

<p>

<u>10: Kill Cespenar</u>
<br>
This component allows you to kill Cespenar. Oh come on, it's fun.

<p>
<u>11: Smarter Illusionary Clones</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the AI Improvements in Quest Pack. (<a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/quest/">http://www.pocketplane.net/quest/</a>)</font>
<br>
This component makes enemy Mislead, Project Image and Simulacrum images behave
more intelligently. They will actually move, for a start. They do not gain any
abilities they did not previously have.
<p>
<u>12: Avenger's Visual Ioun Stones</u>
<br>
This component is largely the product of Avenger's hard work. All credit for
animations and bit discoveries go to him. With it installed, characters
wearing ioun stones will have an animation displayed circling their head
to indicate it. Colours vary according to that of the stone.
<p>
Avenger would like it noted that the following things are fairly cool:<br>
<a href="http://www.forgottenlance.com/games/istar.htm">http://www.forgottenlance.com/games/istar.htm</a> - The Glory of Istar total conversion<br>
<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/tools/dltcep.php">http://www.gibberlings3.net/tools/dltcep.php</a> - The DLTCEP editing tool<br>
<a href="http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/">http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/</a> - The GemRB engine emulator
<p>
This component should be installed AFTER the BG2 Tweak Pack from G3 and AFTER ROgue Revisions in order to patch the ioun stones provided by those mods.

<p>
<u>13: Dual Class Wild Mages</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the BG2 Tweak Pack at G3. (<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/">http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/</a>)</font>
<br>
This component allows Wild Mages to dual-class.
<p>

<u>14: Kensai Ryu's Restored Drow Innate Abilities</u>
<br>
This modification restores the Drow (dark elves) innate AD&amp;D abilities to
them, but only in the underdark, as drow lose those abilities when going to
the surface.
<p>
Abilities:
<li>Globe of Darkness
<li>Dancing Lights
<li>Faerie Fire
<p>
Globe of Darkness:
<br>The target creature must save vs. spells or be under the influence of a Globe
of Darkness and suffer from blindness until the globe is dispelled or it
dissipates naturally. Globes last 1 round for every two levels of the drow
to a maximum of 6 rounds at level 10.
<p>
Improved Globe of Darkness:
<br>The target creature must save vs. spells or be under the influence of a Globe
of Darkness and suffer from blindness until the globe is dispelled or it
dissipates naturally. Globes last 1 round for every two levels of the drow
to a maximum of 6 rounds at level 10. This version has a more severe save vs. spell
bonus, and is only used by higher level drow.
<p>
Dancing Lights:
<br>This spell distracts the target creature if they fail a save vs. spell. The
distraction costs the creature a +2 penalty to THAC0 for 3 rounds, or until
dispelled.
<p>
Faerie Fire:
<br>This spell outlines the target creature in a white fire, if they fail a
save vs. spell costing the target creature a +2 penalty to AC for 6 rounds, or
until dispelled.
<p>
This component is the result of Kensai Ryu's hard work. All praise may be
directed his way, but bug reports or other technical queries should be sent
to SimDing0.

<p>

<u>15: Jaysyn's Displacer Beasts</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the Miscellaneous Enhancements component of Quest Pack. (<a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/quest/">http://www.pocketplane.net/quest/</a>)</font>
<br>
This component uses creatures originally created by Jaysyn. It introduces
Displacer Beasts, creatures listed in AD&amp;D source material, but not present
in BG2. The beasts, and their cousins, Greater Displacer Beasts, are residents
of the Underdark, and supposedly able to appear in several places at once
while attacking.<br>
I have repackaged the creatures, and modified the Underdark resting spawns
to include them.<br>
Jaysyn can be contacted at v0jaysyn0v@yahoo.com
<p>
<u>16: Remove Quayle Portrait</u>
<br>
This component removes Quayle's portrait from BG2. "Why?" I hear you cry.
Quayle was the only non-joinable or non-plot-significant character in BG2
to have a portrait displayed during dialogue. Therefore, for consistency,
it may be removed.
<p>
<u>17: Dream Flag</u>
<br>
There is a way to make areas turn a surreal... brown. This component uses
it for the dream sequences in BG2, making them look that little bit more
unusual. It's probably not for everybody.
<p>
<u>18: Sensible Lore Table</u> <font color="#339900">(BG1Tutu Compatible!)</font>
<br>
This component modifies the lore table to make more sense. The new per-level
values are as follows:
<p>
<TABLE border="1"
          summary="Lore table">
<TH colspan="40">

<TR><TD>FIGHTER<TD>1
<TR><TD>RANGER<TD>2
<TR><TD>PALADIN<TD>2
<TR><TD>MAGE<TD>7
<TR><TD>CLERIC<TD>4
<TR><TD>THIEF<TD>4
<TR><TD>BARD<TD>10
<TR><TD>DRUID<TD>3
<TR><TD>SORCERER<TD>5
<TR><TD>MONK<TD>2
<TR><TD>SHAMAN<TD>5
</TABLE>
<p>
Wisdom bonuses have also been tweaked minorly to improve the gradient with
respect to the average value of 10/11 for any stat.
<p>

<u>19: The_Bigg's Improved Backstabbing</u> <font color="#339900">(BG1Tutu Compatible!)</font>
<br>
In vanilla BG2, backstabbing worked with any weapons usable by pure-class
thieves.<br>
This component does not modify this behaviour. However, it introduces
restrictions when backstabbing with larger weapons. The backstab modifier
is reduced as follows:
<p>
<TABLE border="1"
          summary="Backstab table">
<TH colspan="75">

<TR><TD>Bastard Swords<TD>-2
<TR><TD>Flails<TD>-1
<TR><TD>Halberds<TD>-5
<TR><TD>Long Swords/Katanas<TD>-1
<TR><TD>Two-Handed Swords<TD>-3
<TR><TD>Quarter Staves<TD>-4
<TR><TD>Spears<TD>-3
</TABLE>
<p>
Note that this will have a greater impact when used with the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/aoe/">Ashes of Embers</a>
"Universal Weapons" component.<br>
Dual-wielding will apply the penalty of BOTH weapons.<br>
This component was coded by the_bigg.
<p>

<u>20: Summons/NPCs Set Off Traps</u> <font color="#339900">(BG1Tutu Compatible!)</font>
<br>
This modifies traps throughout BG2 (or Tutu) to be triggered by creatures
outside the party, be they friendly or hostile. This allows you, for example,
to trigger traps by sending summons through them.<br>
Illusions, Wizard Eyes, Shadows, Mists and Air Elementals will not trigger
traps.<br>
This component may cause issues with the Improved Ilyich component of the
Tactics mod. With that component installed, Ilyich can potentially wander
over fatal traps.
<p>

<u>21: CamDawg's Reduced Walking Speeds</u>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Removed! This component is now a part of the BG2 Tweak Pack at G3. (<a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/">http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/</a>)</font>
<br>
This component adjusts the walking speeds of creatures in BG2 to bring them
in line with those of BG1Tutu's walking speed tweak. The new speed is somewhere
between that of vanilla BG1 and BG2. Among other things, this alteration should
make archers more effective throughout the game.
<p>


<u>22: Ghreyfain's BG1-Style Summoning Spells</u> <font color="#339900">(BG1Tutu Compatible!)</font>
<br>
One of the first things that can be noticed in BG2 is how very
weak the Monster Summoning X spells are.  This component strives to bring things more
in-line with how they were in BG1.  Monster Summoning I will summon either 8 level 1
creatures, or 4 level 2 monsters.  Monster Summoning II summons a total of 12 levels of
monsters.  That's either 6 level 2 monsters or 4 level 3 monsters.  MS III will summon
16 levels.  5 level 3 creatures and a 1 level 1, or 4 level 4s, or 3 level 5s and a
level 1 creature.
<br>
Animal summoning works in the same manner.
<br>
Animate Dead will summon 1 skeleton per level of the caster, and now they come equipped
with a random variety of helms, shields, and weapons.  They're also not green.  At level 13, some of these skeletons are exchanged for a Skeleton Warrior, a more powerful ally.
<br>
This component will automatically remove the summoning cap if you have not already done so.

<u><h4><a name="Section2">Section II - Installation</a></h4></u>
ToB may be required for some components. D0Tweak should work fine with other WeiDU mods (including all of those created by the Pocket Plane team).
<p>
D0Tweak should be installed after most (ideally all) other mods.
<p>
Uninstall and remove all previous versions of this mod.  If you had a version before 22 installed, make doubly sure that the file setup-d0tweak.tp2 in your main BG2 folder is gone; this file has moved to the d0tweak folder.
<p>
Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
<br>
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\
<p>
Run (click on) "setup-d0tweak.exe".
<p>
First, pick your favorite language. Currently available:
<li>English
<li>French
<li>Spanish
<li>Polish
<li>German
<li>Japanese
<p>
Then choose which components you would like to install. They are all optional. You may
always uninstall any or all of them later by re-running "setup-d0tweak.exe".
<p>
D0Tweak may work correctly without starting a new game, but it is strongly
recommended that you do so.
<p>
The components should install correctly for international players who have both
DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.
